# Project_2_431
CS431 Project 2 Repository - Sam Grigoli &amp; Gabe Otero

Information:

The language you have to study is

              Ballerina

Refer to my CLASS 20 slides and my in-class remarks.

The procedure is what you know already:
GitHub repo,  invitation to collaborate,  do work ...

If there is any usable VS Code extension for the language, then you
should try to show how it is used to make development using the
language.
